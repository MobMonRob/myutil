Java utilities for statistics/machinelearning and various supporting tools.
(Often intended for NLP applications, though not much NLP in this library.)
This needs a better name; it is "myutil", https://github.com/brendano/myutil

The idea is to be a library of functions for well-known algorithms like
Gaussian inference or CRFs or slice sampling or quasi-Newton optimizers or
fast RNG's (etc...), as opposed to a grand ML/NLP framework, because those are
never as useful as one would hope.

This is under active development so any of it may be broken at any time.
If there are comments with a testing procedure, that may be a good sign.

Let's say new code is GPL version 2.
Note there's code from other libraries inside here too,
like JAMA and LibLBFGS and the Java SDK, which have their own licenses.
